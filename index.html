            <p>Need for Speed (NFS) is a racing game franchise published by Electronic Arts and currently developed by Criterion Games (the developers of the Burnout series). The series generally centers around illegal street racing, and tasks players to complete various types of races while evading the local law enforcement in police pursuits. The series' first title, The Need for Speed, was released in 1994. The recent game, Need for Speed Unbound, was released on December 2, 2022. Additionally, a free-to-play mobile installment released in 2015, Need for Speed: No Limits, is actively developed by the developers of Real Racing 3. The series titles have been overseen and developed by multiple notable teams over the years. Several Need for Speed games have been well-received critically, and the franchise has been one of the most successful of all time, selling over 150 million copies.</p>

            <p>Need for Speed drops you into the middle of the action and leaves the choice of how you will play completely up to you. After completing your first mandatory race you are free to explore the city, finding hidden Jack Points where new cars are available for immediate acquisition. The key to early success in Need for Speed is focus. Explore the city for a while and get your bearings. Serach the back alleys and garages to find a car you like, and then stick with it. Accept some race challenges and build up your Modifications on your chosen vehicle. The sooner you tune a single Car up to decent specs, the sooner you can start winning some police chases for serious Speed Points. The sooner you have Speed Points, the sooner you can challenge the Most Wanted and gain access to their supercars. </p>
